                                    <p>We provide various features and tools that allow users to locate final resting places, send and receive tributes, preserve and share photo and video memories, build a biography and timeline to tell the story of an individual’s life, invite family and friends to funerary and commemorative events, convey remembrances of lost friends and loved ones, and construct a family tree to depict a family’s genealogy. These features and tools shall collectively be known as the “<b>Services</b>”. We offer the Services at www.MyKeeper.com and other websites and applications powered by us (the “<b>Platform</b>”). Please read the following Terms before using the Services.</p>

                                            <p>Visitors to the Platform are “Users”, whether or not they have registered on the Platform. There are three main categories of Users, some with unique sets of rights and responsibilities. The categories are:</p>

                                            <ol type="a">
                                                <li>“<strong>Account Holders</strong>” are individuals with registered accounts on the Platform. Account Holders might be the administrators of one or more memorials or living memorials, or they may have a User account without administrative privileges. Account Holders have profile pages which they control the content of.</li>

                                                <li>“<strong>Keepers</strong>” are Account Holders who create, manage, and administer one or more memorial pages. Keepers have the right to create memorial pages, manage the content on said page, allow other Account Holders to act as Keepers on the memorial pages they manage, and to control the privacy settings of the memorial pages. Keepers should, where possible, be the spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, or grandparent of the subject of the memorial page, or have authorization from one of the above. In the event of a dispute or conflict among, or complaint from Users regarding who is entitled to act as Keeper of a memorial page or any content on said page, we will endeavour to respect the desires of the memorial subject’s immediate family. We reserve for ourselves the sole right to determine whether or how to resolve such dispute, conflict or complaint, with or without factual or other investigation, including the right to remove the page entirely.</li>

                                                <li>“<strong>Guests</strong>” are individuals without registered accounts on the Platform. Guests may view, comment on, and upload to or download content from memorial pages, subject to the administration of the page’s Keeper.</li>
